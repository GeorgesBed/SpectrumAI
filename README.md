# SpectrumAI
R script to automatically inspect MS2 spectra of single-subsititution peptide identifications


SpectrumAI.R is the script to curate PSMs of single-substitution peptides.
plot_mirror_image.R is the script to draw MS2 spectrum mirror image of synthetic and endogenous peptide.
plot_annotated_spectrum.R is the script to draw annotated spectra of any PSM. (matched b,y ions to theorectial spectrum will be highlighted)
